	I studied at Andres Soriano College in 2012 and graduated in 2018. Even in higshchool i'm still one of the top students in the class and gain a lot of awards. I evolve myself and manage to learn a lot of things like creating designs and make posters for other person and earn money. It was fun and i enjoy it working for other person. Because of it i develop my self and think more mature. I also help my parents in personal expenses and i manage to purchase things i need using my own effort and income.

	Because of my passion in art , design and computer, i studied college at Caraga State University in 2018 and took Bachelor of science Information Technology. I am a 3rd year student now and for me college is one of the stressfull things i faced in life. But because of the experience i have when i was in highschool and the encouragement of my family and friends i manage to survive for 3 years of existence in the university and hoping to graduate soon and land a stable and wonderful job in the future.
