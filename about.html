			<p>Hi, my name is Ryan Joel T. Castro i am the CEO of webNatics. I'm one of the new rising web developers of the world. When i was 15 i learned how to design and create outlines. Because of this i also won a lot of drawing contest in my school. At my young age i always work hard to create a lot of wonderful design , but i do not have any interest in web developing and programming. By the time i graduated highschool i continue my passion in art and design. I study information computer technology in señor highschool and i found it fun and interesting. Many things happened during my señor highschool days. I learned basic computer programming and computer hardware repairs. At the age of 18 i graduated Señor higschool. Some people said i am a geek and a wierd person, because sometimes i lock myself in my room doing a lot of improvement to my profound skills. I continue my interest in computer design and programming in Caraga State University , so i took Bachelor of science Information Technology (BSIT). It is not that easy to learn in college specially when you are a stubborn person like me. But the luck is with me and i manage to survive it with the help of my friends and family. When i was in college i was not that good, but i have my own strategies in life, so i dicided to focus in web design because that is where i am good at. And now here i am, the stubborn kid that sit in a chair and code for life. Life is a journey that doesnt stop in a single loop, it is a continous loop of time and wonderful things. Everyday we learn new things and we might use it to pierce through problems in life. If you have a dream then don't just sit there! work hard and create an outline to achieve your goals and dreams in life.  </p>
